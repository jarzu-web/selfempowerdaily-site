        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 27, 2026</p>

        <p>Self Empower Daily ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>The short version:</strong> Your voice recordings stay on your device. We never collect, store, or sell your personal audio data on our servers.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <p><strong>Name.</strong> You provide your first name during setup. This is stored locally on your device and used to personalize your experience within the app.</p>

        <p><strong>Voice Recordings.</strong> You record answers to four questions during onboarding. These recordings are stored locally on your device and are used solely to create your personalized voice clone through our third-party voice synthesis provider (ElevenLabs). Recordings are transmitted to ElevenLabs only for the purpose of voice cloning and text-to-speech generation.</p>

        <p><strong>Usage Preferences.</strong> Your selected morning ritual time, streak data, and app preferences are stored locally on your device using on-device storage.</p>

        <p><strong>Subscription Information.</strong> If you subscribe, payment processing is handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or store any payment information, credit card numbers, or billing details.</p>

        <h2>How Your Voice Data Is Processed</h2>

        <p>To create your personalized affirmation experience, your voice recordings are sent to ElevenLabs, a third-party voice synthesis service, for the following purposes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Creating a voice clone that sounds like you</li>
            <li>Generating spoken affirmations using your cloned voice</li>
            <li>Transcribing your recorded answers to personalize affirmation content</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your recorded answers are also sent (as transcribed text, not audio) to Anthropic's Claude AI service to generate personalized affirmation scripts based on your goals. No personally identifiable information beyond your transcribed answers is shared with Anthropic.</p>

        <p>These third-party services process your data according to their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review them:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy" target="_blank">Anthropic Privacy Policy</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What We Do NOT Collect</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>We do not store your voice recordings on our servers</li>
            <li>We do not collect your location data</li>
            <li>We do not collect your contacts or address book</li>
            <li>We do not track you across other apps or websites</li>
            <li>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with advertisers</li>
            <li>We do not use your data for targeted advertising</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <p>Your name, voice recordings, preferences, and streak data are stored locally on your device in the app's private sandboxed storage. This means no other app on your device can access this information. API communications with our cloud services are encrypted using HTTPS.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>Self Empower Daily includes a Teen mode designed for users aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>

        <p>You can delete all your data at any time by deleting the Self Empower Daily app from your device. This removes all locally stored recordings, preferences, and personal information. To request deletion of any voice clone data stored by ElevenLabs, please contact us at the email below.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated policy within the app. Your continued use of the app after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
